## Overview
Vote Betch is a web application created for the user voter who can look up the voter information for the upcoming election without feeling overwhelmed with the legalese jargon, the mis-trust from social media or simply lack confidence when it comes to voting. 

With this in mind,  weâ€™ve set out to resolve these issues 
 
Lack of confidence

Overwhelmed by information

Mistrustful of media and news sources 

Therefore,  they are reluctant to vote.
